### Opening Remarks

**(00:10)** Heat. Heat. We'll let some more people trickle in and then we'll... Well, good afternoon everyone. Thank you so much for being with us for this day of our first ever capital conference. We're really looking forward to all of the conversations that we're having today, especially for what we're going to take away as we're continuing to do our work within the inter agency and also with the Federal Reserve on capital and as we're looking to the future of banking more generally.

**(01:20)** I also want to take a moment to thank our panel participants before we get started with our fireside chat this afternoon. Thank you for taking time to be a part of this important conversation. As we're thinking about what regulation will look like in this space and in many others, we really look forward to engaging with you as we continue to have these discussions.

**(01:44)** But today in many ways is about the future of banking. And with that in mind, we'd like to now turn to another influence that's shaping innovation and finance. While innovation has always played a role in the evolution of the banking industry, it's becoming clear that new technologies are not merely incremental improvements, but potentially huge leaps that could fundamentally alter the structure and function of our financial system.

**(02:11)** One of these technologies, of course, is artificial intelligence. And I can't think of anyone who's better situated or prepared to discuss AI and the role of innovation in transforming finance and our economy more generally than Sam Altman, the chairman and CEO of OpenAI. Sam, thank you for making time to be with us today. I want to welcome you. Thank you for being here.

**Sam Altman:** Thank you very much for having me.

### AI Landscape and Innovation Framework

**(02:41)** **Moderator:** So it might be helpful just to sort of frame where we are with the landscape of AI and innovation more broadly. Would you just kind of set that framework for us?

**Sam Altman:** Sure. Only five years ago, AI was still thought of as something that was in the distant future if it was going to happen at all.

**(03:02)** And even 2 and 1/2 years ago which was right around the time ChatGPT launched, it still hadn't moved past the sort of nerds in Silicon Valley. ChatGPT launched on November 30th of 2022 - that was even before GPT-4 and since then the progress has been quite rapid. The adoption, the economic impact has also started to be quite rapid.

Just last week we had a model that was able to achieve gold level performance on the IMO [International Mathematical Olympiad]. This is something that I think if you told most people in the field would happen even a few years ago, they would say absolutely not. You know, that's like that's as good as our smartest humans that are true experts in their field.

**(03:39)** We're now hearing from scientists saying they're two, three times more productive. We're hearing from computer programmers that say they're 10 times more productive. It's completely changed what it means to write software.

**(03:56)** We have systems already that can perform at expert level intelligence in many many fields. Now they cannot operate on tasks that are as long horizon as humans can. So there's still a big limitation there. But even if progress were frozen right now, which of course it won't be, I think we would still have years ahead of us for society and the economy to really digest this technology and figure out what the impact is going to be.

### Intelligence as a Commodity

**(04:21)** You know, there was a saying along for a long ti me that I thought was great and we should try to get to again, which is "electricity too cheap to meter." And we didn't quite deliver on that as a society, although I think we still should. It does in fact look like we're about to deliver on "intelligence too cheap to meter."

**(04:41)** We've been able to drive down the cost of each unit of intelligence by more than a factor of 10 each year for the last 5 years. Looks like we'll do that for the next five years, too. Maybe even more.

This weekend I used one of our upcoming models to do a computer programming task that I had wanted to do.

**(05:01)** Sort of like a home automation nerd and I wanted like the lights and music in my house to do this specific thing. I knew that before this technology, it would have taken me days to do that. I was hopeful that with this technology, given our recent progress, I'd be able to do it in hours. I was able to do it in 5 minutes.

**(05:17)** They did almost all of the work. This is something that, you know, just a year ago you would have paid a very high-end programmer 20 hours, 40 hours, something like that to do. And an AI did it for probably less than a dollar's worth of compute tokens. So this is an amazing change and the speed with which it has happened, the speed with which it will continue for the next few years, I think is still quite unappreciated.

**(05:46)** We weren't sure even a year ago how much further our current research roadmap was going to continue if we're going to hit some sort of limit. At this point it looks like we've got many years ahead of us of almost certain progress.

**Moderator:** Well, fantastic.

### Comparing AI to Previous Technology Revolutions

**(06:03)** **Moderator:** That really helps us frame the next conversation which is you're talking to a room full of people in the financial industry and in banking many of whom are already thinking about how they're going to use AI or already using AI. But how could you compare the potential for AI and productivity with other tech gains that we've seen in the past? You know, I'm of of the the age that um I was in just starting business when uh the internet became something that we used uh more broadly.

**(06:34)** So, how could you kind of frame that for us and is there an analogy that you might use to describe where we are?

**Sam Altman:** I've never seen a technology revolution quite like this. You know, the historical examples are people talk about the industrial revolution, they talk about the computer revolution. The internet did change a lot of things, but I don't ever remember something that, you know, would have cost $10,000 of knowledge work a year ago costing a dollar or 10 cents or whatever it would cost now.

**(07:05)** like this is, you know, for my programming example from a minute ago, um I think this is just unprecedented. Now, it doesn't work like that for everything. Things in the physical world, robots, whatever, that's going to take a lot longer. Like we will, you know, maybe in 2030 it cost $10 to have an Uber driver for an hour, and in 2040 it will cost $1, but that's going to be a much slower transition.

**(08:39)** [Content appears to have some gaps in the original transcript]

The best historical analog I can think of is the transistor. The transistor was this thing that turned out to be very hard to discover, easy to understand once you understood it, completely economically transformative and the value sort of diffused throughout all of society as a massive productivity win. But there was a short period of time where there were a lot of companies - they called them semiconductor companies and it was this huge boom and most of those companies didn't survive.

But now they're kind of like in the background. You're all using devices with lots of transistors in them. There are scaling laws with AI where it just gets better and better and we learn how to really industrialize this and put this everywhere.

**(10:05)** So I think that's the best historical analog and we did see phenomenal productivity gains because of the transistor. But again, what we're seeing now with AI - to say nothing of the weird cases like the fact that at some point AI can invent its own next versions and really accelerate progress even further - with what we're seeing right now, this just goes beyond what I can predict.

### Impact on Jobs and Society

**(11:21)** There are totally - there are cases where entire classes of jobs will go away. There are entirely new classes of jobs that will come. And largely I think this will look somewhat like most of history in that the tools people have to use in their jobs will let them do more, achieve things in new ways.

**(11:39)** What it means to be a doctor or a lawyer or a computer programmer clearly will change but people will still need medical care and they want to talk to a human. People will still need legal advice and they'll want to talk to a human about that.

**(12:44)** And so I don't think the fundamental things that make us work and kind of animate society are going to go anywhere. And we'll probably all still be complaining that we have to work too hard even though we're unimaginably rich. Probably if we could look from today at the people 100 years in the future, we would look at those jobs and say those are not real jobs. You are not actually busy.

**(13:04)** You have unimaginable luxury. You have everything you could possibly need.

### Banking Industry Adoption and Concerns

**(14:32)** [Some content appears fragmented in original]

One story that stuck with me is: "Hey you know we realize this is a new technology we've got to put some new controls on it but the risk of us not doing this... if we don't adopt this, the risk is that we don't continue to exist as a business. We know we cannot compete with - if we're a bank - we know we cannot compete with a new bank that is really going to build an AI first experience and use AI for the entire stack of things."

### Fraud and Security Concerns

**(15:57)** **Moderator:** So, it was one of the most innovative industries... something that the banking industry is really interested in right now is fraud and impersonating individuals to facilitate fraud. Are there ways that we could mitigate that kind of activity or that we should safeguard if there is the use of AI or identification of that type of impersonation?

**Sam Altman:** Great, great question. I am very nervous about this.

**(17:20)** A thing that terrifies me is apparently there are still some financial institutions that will accept a voice call. That is going to get so compelling.

**(18:23)** Society has to deal with this problem more generally, but people are going to have to change the way they interact. They're going to have to change the way they verify - like this person calling me right now. It's a voice call. Soon it's going to be a video FaceTime indistinguishable from reality.

**(18:39)** And teaching people how to authenticate in a world like that, how to think about the fraud impacts. This is a huge deal.

### Education System Transformation

**(20:10)** [Discussion about calculator introduction to education]
When the calculator came out, math teachers at the time apparently said, "This is a disaster. This is the end of math education. If you don't have to learn how to use a slide rule or look up stuff in the logarithms books or whatever they did at the time, why bother to teach anyone math? Like, this is, you know, these kids are never going to learn."

And it was apparently a real meltdown. And of course, what happened is with better tools, we use our brain power for something else.

**(21:15)** I could do something better with that hour of my life. And again what happened - so there was like this brief effort at my school to ban Google and get these pledges not to use it and whatever. And then people realized like oh man we can expect - we can give our students more tools and we can expect more out of them.

**(21:38)** And sure maybe they drive to the library a little bit less but they can use that time to think harder or you know come up with better ideas.

**(22:54)** [Discussion about ChatGPT in education]
I'm hearing from superintendents from serious high up people in the world of education saying actually we made a huge mistake. This is the best learning tool ever. You know our students at least our sort of self-starting students are using this to go learn anything.

If we ban this from our schools we're just not going to be globally competitive. And we've got to retool our curriculum because this is like the calculator. And you know, now we have a calculator for words. So, sure, maybe they can't write a five paragraph essay without it anymore but give them assignments that require them to use tools like ChatGPT that cannot be done without it. That's fine but expect much more out of them and I still hope we're going to get there.

**Moderator:** Sounds like a transformation of our education system.

**Sam Altman:** But it has to be - like these, you know, these kids are going to grow up and be adults with unbelievably powerful AI. And if we're not training them for that world, we've really missed the mark.

**Moderator:** That's very helpful. Thank you.

### Real-World Business Applications

**(24:33)** [Discussion about early ChatGPT business uses]

**(25:45)** And everybody has their favorite, but I'll tell you my favorite. I was in an Uber and the Uber driver was telling me about this amazing new thing called ChatGPT and asking if I'd heard of it and I was like, "Oh yeah, like you know what are you doing with it?" And he was like, "It's the craziest thing. I have this small business."

**(26:06)** [Content about automation and business processes]

**(27:05)** But the creative spirit of people that were just doing this inside of ChatGPT like way back in the stone age really stuck with me and now it feels like it's on easy mode and people are doing that in all sorts of amazing ways.

**Moderator:** It's really transformational I think for me. The first time I used it, I was trying to write a haiku for a company toast at an innovation conference.

**(28:56)** What's cool about these models is they understand us in natural language and they are so steerable. So if you say hey you can go look at all this data to make a decision but don't consider X Y or Z at all - like don't let that have any factor - it generally speaking will really be good at following that.

### AI Ethics and Morality

**(30:35)** **Question about AI ethics:** My question for you is will AI evolve its own morality?

**Sam Altman:** I think people get very confused about whether they want AI to be a tool or a creature. And I'm very much in the tool camp. I don't think AI will have independent morality. I think that AI can certainly learn, you know, really study humanity and our the best of our thinking. It can probably help us point out here's a problem in your thinking. Here's a thing that should be different.

### Communication and Workflow Changes

**(32:21)** [Discussion about email communication patterns]
The reason I was smiling is there's this funny thing that happens. Older people or people who are used to emailing with a certain kind of etiquette will type out the bullet points that they want to communicate, put it into ChatGPT. ChatGPT will write this long nice formal email with a bunch of fluff and the bullet points somewhere in there. They'll send it across to somebody else. That person will put it back into ChatGPT and say, "Please summarize this for me."

**(33:39)** [Discussion about AI assistants and productivity]
You know, focused working. It can tell when I'm in a meeting. It can tell when I'm like got some time to think. It can override if necessary. Otherwise, it can nicely summarize stuff, respond to things for me, pull the things together.

And, you know, I want like that bullet point condensed thing. And I don't want the fluff. And I don't have to go around and click around and I don't have to respond to stuff I don't want to respond to.

### Labor Supply and Demand

**(35:11)** [Discussion about healthcare and service industries]
When you are sitting in a doctor's office waiting room for an hour, I think that just means under supply of doctors or that the doctors aren't productive enough and you know, it would be great if the doctor's waiting around and as soon as you get there like they're ready to see you and they have the whole thing ready to go. Lots of other examples like this.

**(35:30)** Every time you're [calling customer service and] the thing just happens. It's done. Answers right away. Great. Now I don't want to go back there.

**(36:35)** And I also don't - it doesn't bother me at all that that's an AI and not a real person. So that's a category where I would just say, you know what, when you call customer support, you're going to be talking to an AI and that's fine. A lot of these other things I really do want a human doctor.

**(36:55)** ChatGPT today by the way most of the time can give you better [medical advice] - it's like a better diagnostician than most doctors.

**(38:10)** I think the world wants a gigantic amount more software, 100 times, maybe a thousand times more software. So maybe each person can now write 10 times as much software. They're going to make three times as much. The world will be happy because the world has way more software. The programmers will be happy, too.

And I think we'll see many categories like that. Things in the physical world will keep being done by humans for a while, but when this robotics wave comes crashing in...

### AI Safety and Risks

**(39:33)** [Discussion about AI risks]
[Someone with malicious intent could use AI] to design a bioweapon to take down the United States power grid, to break into the financial system and take everyone's money. Something that would just be hard to imagine without significantly superhuman intelligence but with it becomes very possible and because we don't have that we can't defend against it. So that's category - broad category one.

And I think that the bio capability of these models, the cyber security capability of these models, these are getting quite strong.

**(41:01)** [Long-term risks discussion]
This is the category where the models kind of accidentally take over the world. They never wake up. They never do the sci-fi thing. They never open the pod bay doors, but they just become so ingrained in society and they're so much smarter than we are. And we can't really understand what they're doing. But we do kind of have to rely on them. And even without a drop of malevolence from anyone, society can just veer in a sort of strange direction.

### Human Relevance and Chess Analogy

**(42:25)** [Discussion about human relevance post-AI]
Chess has never been more popular than it is today. People love to watch chess. Something we're very focused on real people doing like real people things. So, there was like a very interesting thing that happened there.

But this phenomenon I think is a really big deal in the short term. You can see it where people - maybe we call this emotional over-reliance. People rely on ChatGPT too much.

**(42:49)** There's young people who just say like I can't make any decision... [without AI]. It doesn't matter on an individual case but it means that society has collectively transitioned a significant part of decision-making to this very powerful system that is learning from us, improving with us, evolving with us but in ways we don't totally understand.

**(44:10)** So that's the third category of how I think things can go wrong.

### Banking Innovation and Closing

**Moderator:** I think there was one question behind you Rob and then I might just ask you to wrap up by helping us encourage innovation in the banking system and how you might recommend we do that.

**(45:23)** [Final discussion about banking innovation]
Every business really enabled with this level of technology to be able to give better financial advice, to detect fraud better, to underwrite risk better. Again watching what is possible now makes me very optimistic in the developed world. I think the biggest challenge will be risk tolerance and regulation for very good reasons but about how quickly do you want to adopt these things and I think like we've [discussed]... for innovation to occur?

**(47:03)** Promise I didn't come here for the TV commercial, but we'd love to work with any of you, of course. But no, whether it is us or one of our competitors, I think that just in the last 6 months as reasoning models have really rolled out this transition from these models that could think not at all and had to give an instant response to models that can think for many seconds or many minutes.

**(47:23)** And the robustness...
